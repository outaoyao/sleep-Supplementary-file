# To ensure the reproducibility of the analysis results, it is recommended to run each code file in a new R session. All code files are designed to run independently. If execution errors occur, please restart RStudio and run the code again.
# The reproducible code and main script svyggrcs1.8R.R for this study have been uploaded to GitHub. The analysis utilizes the data file 2017-2023R data 11059_1.csv. The file paths within the code (e.g., D:\Supplementary file\) must be adjusted accordingly by the user based on their local environment.
